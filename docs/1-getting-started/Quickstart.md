## How to Start Contract Development
For developers who want to develop smart contract on IOST, we provide a step-by-step [realworld example](5-lucky-bet/Design-Tech-data.md). It introduces how to deploy and run contracts.   

You can also ask questions on our [official forum](https://forum.iost.io).


## How to join IOST Network
For developers who want to join IOST network as a node，the [Access the Testnet](4-running-iost-node/Deployment.md) documentation may be helpful.

If you want to publish smart contracts on IOST，you need some initial coins to pay for gas. You can apply for the initial coins [here](4-running-iost-node/Faucet.md).
